\section{Our Approach}

In this thesis, we will design an algorithm that would evaluate the affect of a perturbation on class confidence of two multi-label classifiers with the same architecture, for a given class $c'$. A naive algorithm simply encodes the two architectures into MILP verifier ~\cite{MIPVERIFY}. This shall be addressed as 'Base Approach'. Although this algorithm grantees accuracy, it is lack of scalability, and causes long execution times. Therefore, our goal is to enhance the scalability and cut the execution time. Our approach consists 3 main stages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Encoding into MILP verifier the problem definition.
    \item Pruning the search space by computing dependencies stemming from the perturbation or the networks' computations
    \item Finding the upper and lower bounds using anytime optimization called Gurobi.
\end{itemize}
As shown in Preliminary Results section, our approach manages to significantly improve execution times while maintaining accuracy of the algorithm.
