\section{Future Research Objectives}
In light of the preliminary work, we aim to further explore our ideas in the following directions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generalizing to networks over a large range of differences: We aim to extend our approach for networks that have a wider range of differences, for example changes over different layers and large value differences. This requires to extend our algorithm to automatically identify the differences.
    %\item Applying our algorithm to networks trained on databases other than MNIST.
    \item Identifying dependencies: as the networks differ from one another, the need to identify dependencies and reduce the search space increases. Our goal is to pinpoint constraints between the variables of the two networks, as defined by MILP.
   % \item Identifying optimization hints using numerical optimization: Vhagar~\cite{VHAGAR} relied on numerical optimization to prune the MILP's search space. We expect that a similar approach is applicable to our setting. %These are partial assignments to the MIPâ€™s variables. It is used for guiding towards the optimal solution. It reduces execution times and enhances the scalability of the system.
\end{itemize}
