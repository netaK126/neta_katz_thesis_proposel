\section{Future Research Objectives}
In light of the preliminary work, we aim to further explore our ideas in the following directions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generalizing to networks who differentiate in several weights' values. Currently our approach was only examine on two networks, with a single difference in one of the values on the last layer. Examining our algorithm over networks that have more differences between them can simulate a realistic situation and we can draw better conclusions and improvements.
    \item Applying our algorithm to networks trained on databases other than MNIST.
    \item Finding more constraints between the networks. As the preliminary results section presented, pruning the search space using constraints between the networks, significantly reduces the execution time. Therefore, we hypothesize that expanding the pruning of the search space could further decrease execution times.
    \item Identifying optimization hints. These are partial assignments to the MIPâ€™s variables. It is used for guiding towards the optimal solution. It reduces execution times and enhances the scalability of the system.
\end{itemize}
